= Logging

We use https://github.com/ptaoussanis/timbre[Timbre] as a logging tool. It gives us a flexible way to log with multiple log-levels and the ability to filter the messages by level, namespace and appender.

It is simple to use and it handles stuff like automatic concatenation of strings so you don't need to do that yourself.

.Example
[source,clojure]
----
(log/debug ::my-module "Value of foo:" foo "Value of bar:" bar)
----

This gives us the following line in the javascript console log:

[source]
----
2021-12-01T13:20:34.605Z DEBUG [cljs.user:1] - :cljs.user/my-module Value of foo: I am the value of foo Value of bar: I am the value of bar
----
