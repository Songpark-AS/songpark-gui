== Deployment

We have a Makefile that we use to build Docker images of the application and deploy them to different namespaces on Kubernetes.

When you run a build command for instance: `make build-staging` it will replace the `config.js` file with `config.staging.js` and it will insert the version number (derived from the current git commit hash) into the config file available as a variable within the application.

Then it will build the image with docker and tag it appropriately.

If you run `make deploy-staging` it will do everything the build command did but it will also push the docker image and deploy it to the kubernetes cluster.
